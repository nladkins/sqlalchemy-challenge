The purpose of this repository is to provide code associated with an analysis conducted for station data across Hawaii.  In this data, precipitation and temperature values were collected across 9 stations over a given period of time.  To analyze this data, the following actions were taken:

1. Connecting to the database.
2. Evaluate the data types.
3. Narrowed in a given period of time.  
4. Organize the data and generate data frames.
4. Leveraged time dependencies to generate plots for precipitation and temperature over the same periods of time, particularly for the station that had the most data available.  

This repository might be useful for individuals evaluating climate data for a prolonged period of time.
